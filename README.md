# weatherLampProject

Quick glance lamp that changes color based on time, weather condition, and temperature.

This project was based on and used the STL files used From 

https://github.com/MukeshSankhla/WiznetWeatherLamp

https://www.instructables.com/Weather-Lamp/

The code was changed to reflect more weather conditions, properly convert the api time to 24 hour clock in a base GMT timezone,
and modified to work with Raspberry pi PICO W.
Although the Timezone Stays in GMT the set Color changes are to coincide with Central Standard Time and Weather location is set to the Oklahoma City  location.
API openweather Key is removed for future use.
